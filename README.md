# ISLA-Chatbot-V2 (CoreNLP-ChatAgent)

Emulate a chatbot like experience using just NLP processing and pattern recognition.

This project makes use of the Stanford CoreNLP library to perform various functions such as POS tagging, intent recognition, semantic analysis, etc. It aims to achieve chat capabilities using just the basic NLP fucntions provided by the library, and offers an interactie GUI for the user to interact with this chatbot. 

This REPO extends the development of V1, and includes the entire project. 

Below is a description of the first iteration of the project‚¨áÔ∏è

ISLA is a simple chatbot created in the purpose for me to learn about prorgamming and just as a somewhat personal side project that I am dedicating time to.

This project started back when I was still in Grade 11 (summer of 2020). It contains code that is what I consider now to be quite elementary and has a very basic rule-based system for conversation making with the user. The program contains a few API calls for real time information such as the weather, time, dictionary explanation of words.

A detailed devlog can be found via this link. It contains brainstorming ideas, improvements made upon old implementations, personal thoughts, along with progress and challenges during the development.
